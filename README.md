# LongerDays

### Description:
"LongerDays" allows adjustment of the time intervals for the default day and night cycles on your Spigot server. This was requested by a friend of mine for personal use, but I figured it could also be uploaded for public use.

### Installation:
1. Copy LongerDays.jar into your /plugins directory
2. Start your server
3. Edit your config.yml

### Configuration:
- day - integer (minutes) for day cycle
- night - integer (minutes) for night cycle
- night-skipping - boolean to enable or disable night skipping
- players-sleeping-percentage - integer percentage of players that must be sleeping for night skipping
- worlds - string list of world names in which to enable this plugin
